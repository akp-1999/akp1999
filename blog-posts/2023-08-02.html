            Hi, This is my first blog upload. I'm still in the process of making this webpage. It's been quite a while since I have created fun lil html pages.
            I have a vague vision for what I want these pages to be, I'm thinking ultra simple plain text-image style. Sort of like a personal archive/directory
            of ⋆｡°✩ assorted/curated/found/hoarded/stolen/created/remixed/interpreted stuff ⋆｡°✩ 
        </p>
